Blogging about my time in flatiron
After three weeks of coding camp the most important lessons I’ve learned are that projects require working in thin vertical slices and that google can solve most, if not all problems.  
Projects require setting attainable goals, and then working in small steps to achieve the first goal. Initially, I was working on a CLI CRUD app with a partner and we set a lofty goal for ourselves, recommending breweries, museums and live shows to people across Denver. We would have liked to include features such as searching by price, location, city, name, leaving reviews and then suggesting options near ones that user selected. After tackling the project from a “big picture” perspective for a day and a half with little to show for it, my partner and I scrapped everything. After settling on a more attainable goal of selecting breweries, we made much more progress and hit our main feature the day before the deadline. Working in small steps allows you to fix bugs as you go and to debug much smaller pieces of code. Debugging a page or two of code is much more tedious than debugging as you go.
